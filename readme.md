#### Backend API URL: https://sxc6zl1mfd.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/v1

Here I used this hosted backend API for REST operations in the frontend



### It is hosted on aws lambda
### Tech Stack
- Lambda (TypeScript)
- OpenapiBackend (it works as a middleware and does all the api request validation, authorization and others.)
- MongoDB (mongoose)
- Github Actions for CI/CD
